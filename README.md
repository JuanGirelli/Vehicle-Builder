## Description

The Vehicle Builder is a TypeScript command-line application that allows users to create new vehicles (cars, trucks, and motorbikes) or select existing ones to perform a variety of actions. This application demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript, including class inheritance and interfaces. The primary aim is to extend the codebase to introduce new vehicle types and actions, providing a comprehensive understanding of working with TypeScript classes.

## Features

- **Create and Manage Vehicles**: Create cars, trucks, and motorbikes, each with unique properties.
- **Select Existing Vehicles**: Choose from the list of created vehicles to perform actions.
- **Perform Actions**: Execute specific actions based on the vehicle type, such as towing for trucks and wheelies for motorbikes.
- **Interactive CLI**: Uses the `Inquirer` package to collect user input and provide a user-friendly command-line interface.
